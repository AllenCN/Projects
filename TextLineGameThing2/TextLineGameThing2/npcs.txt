Mint
A scared bystander who wants to see Boss Mad taken down, but doesn't know if it can be done.
A-are you here to take on Boss Mad? Do you not know how strong he is!?
I-I don't fight...!
I... don't have things to sell you...

A man whose prospects have been in the shitter for a while. He'll help you out... for a price!
You want somethin'? Use the SHOP command to talk to me.
I don't fight. If I did, you think I'd still be in business?
Welcome! I'll sell you whatever you need to take down that bastard!
Anything else you need?
Thank you, and give that bastard Boss Mad hell from me!

DAVE
Dave
An old sage who can make you stronger if you're willing. He, too, wishes to see Boss Mad taken down.
Do you feel you're not strong enough to take on Boss Mad? Train with me using the ENGAGE command.
You wish to train with me? Very well, but I warn you, I am pretty sink-or-swim...
I don't have anything to sell.

BOSS
Boss Mad
The main villain of the game. He looks just as imposing as you'd expect him to.
A newcomer, huh? You got what it takes to stand up to me?
So you think you got what it takes to stand up to me? Prepare to have that thought crushed out of you!
The only thing I sell is an ass-kicking. Get out of here with that!
